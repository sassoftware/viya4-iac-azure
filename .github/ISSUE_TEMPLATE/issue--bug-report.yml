        We ask this to be sure you are currently running a supported terraform version from your work environment.

        Run `./files/tools/iac_tooling_version.sh` to show the version

        If you are not running the latest version of Terraform we support, please try upgrading because your issue may have already been fixed.

        If you're not sure which versions are supported, here's a link : https://github.com/sassoftware/viya4-iac-azure?tab=readme-ov-file#terraform-requirements to help.
